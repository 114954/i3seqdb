# Tracking and instrumentation of NGS

## Initial planning
1. Language
  - Python 2
2. Choice of persistence layer
  - sqlalchemy is a close analog of Java's Hibernate and familiar to me.
3. Choice of MVC
  - Flask appears fairly clean, combine also with the following:
    - Bootstrap
    - WTForms
    - Datatables
